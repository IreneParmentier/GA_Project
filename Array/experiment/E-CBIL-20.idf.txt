Experiment Description	Human pancreatic islets isolated from 7 people with normal glucose tolerance, and 5 people with type 2 diabetes. All 12 people were organ donors after either cerebrovascular accident or intracerebral haemorrhage. Normals were required to maintain glucose at least 6.1mM in intensive care. Diabetic subjects were all at least 10 years from diagnosis and not insulin-requiring. For every subject, RNA was isolated, cRNA was made and hybridized to the U133A and U133B Affymetrix arrays (total of 24 arrays). No samples were pooled.
